    <p class="p3">
To think that we are just specs of dead star dust takes a lot of pressure off of my shoulders honestly. We are (or maybe just I am) sitting here trying to understand why I’m here at this moment in time and what my purpose is, but really I’m just a small part of universe trying to understand the universe. Blah blah blah, poetic and confusing, but also kind of relieving. Even if I don’t find the meaning of life or what my purpose on this earth is or any of that bullshit, at least I get to know we are all dead stars, like that’s pretty epic. Have more things to say here but don't know how to say em... [work in progress].</p>
